# What DevRel Metrics Actually Matter

DevRel is often measured with the wrong metrics.

Followers, impressions, and likes might look good on a dashboard, but they don’t tell you whether developers are actually succeeding.

Let’s talk about the metrics that matter — and why.

---

## 🧠 The Core Question
Every DevRel metric should answer one simple question:

> Are developers able to understand, use, and ship with this product more easily than before?

If a metric doesn’t move that needle, it’s probably vanity.

---

## 🚫 Metrics That Don’t Tell the Full Story
These are not useless, but they are incomplete on their own:

- Social media impressions
- Follower count
- Event registrations
- Content views
- Discord member count

They measure **reach**, not **enablement**.

---

## ✅ Metrics That Actually Matter

### 1️⃣ Time-to-First-Success
How long does it take a new developer to:
- Set up their environment?
- Deploy their first contract?
- Complete a basic task?

Shorter time = better DevRel.

This is one of the strongest indicators of good onboarding.

---

### 2️⃣ Repeated Questions (Friction Signals)
Pay attention to:
- Questions asked repeatedly in Discord
- Common GitHub issues
- Workshop questions that come up every time

If the same questions keep appearing, something is unclear.

DevRel success means **fewer repeated blockers over time**.

---

### 3️⃣ Documentation Effectiveness
Good docs don’t just exist — they get used.

Track:
- Docs referenced in support answers
- PRs improving docs
- Reduced support load after doc updates
- Developers solving problems without asking

Silence can be a good sign here.

---

### 4️⃣ Community-to-Builder Conversion
Not everyone in a community is building — and that’s okay.

What matters is:
- How many members actually try to build?
- How many progress beyond the first step?
- How many return to build again?

DevRel is about movement, not just presence.

---

### 5️⃣ Contributor Growth
Healthy DevRel creates contributors.

Look for:
- First-time contributors
- Docs PRs from the community
- Developers helping other developers
- Ownership spreading beyond core teams

This is DevRel compounding.

---

### 6️⃣ Feedback Loop Closure
Feedback without action is noise.

Track:
- Developer feedback collected
- Issues created from that feedback
- Improvements shipped
- Feedback communicated back to developers

Closing the loop builds trust.

---

## 📊 Qualitative Metrics Matter Too
Not everything worth measuring is numeric.

Pay attention to:
- Better quality questions
- Developers referencing docs correctly
- Community members answering each other
- Builders recommending resources organically

These signals take time — but they’re real.

---

## 🧭 A Practical DevRel Metrics Stack
If you need a simple framework, track:
- **Input**: workshops, docs, guides
- **Friction**: where developers get stuck
- **Output**: deployments, contributors, retention
- **Feedback**: what developers say and do next

Keep it lightweight. Over-measuring kills momentum.

---


DevRel metrics should guide **better decisions**, not just reporting.

If your metrics don’t help you improve the developer experience, you’re measuring the wrong things.
