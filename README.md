# DevRel Playbook 📘

This repository is a **practical DevRel playbook** based on real execution — workshops, community programs, developer support, and ecosystem work.

No fluff. No theory-only takes.  
Just what actually works when doing Developer Relations.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists
DevRel is often misunderstood as just:
- Content
- Social media
- Events

In reality, DevRel sits at the intersection of:
- Developer experience
- Education
- Community
- Product feedback

This playbook documents **how I approach DevRel in practice**.

---

## 👋 Who This Is For
- Developer Relations practitioners
- Dev advocates & community managers
- Engineers moving into DevRel
- Ecosystem teams
- Builders running developer programs

If you care about *developers actually shipping*, this is for you.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here
This repository will grow over time and may include:

- DevRel frameworks & mental models
- Workshop & event playbooks
- Community onboarding systems
- Feedback loops between devs & product teams
- Metrics that actually matter in DevRel
- Notes from real programs and experiments

Everything here is based on **doing**, not just observing.

## 🧩 Core DevRel Principles (My Lens)

- Clarity > complexity  
- Builders first, always  
- Education should be practical  
- Community is a system, not a chat group  
- Documentation is a DevRel superpower  
- Feedback is part of the product

These principles guide every decision.

## 🌍 Context
My DevRel experience includes:
- Running developer workshops and campus programs
- Supporting builders via GitHub, docs, and live sessions
- Leading community initiatives (e.g. ChainConnectNG)
- Collaborating across multiple blockchain ecosystems
- Translating developer feedback into better learning resources

This repo reflects that lived experience.

## 📌 Real-World Context
This playbook is informed by hands-on DevRel work, including:

- Running developer workshops and campus programs
- Supporting builders through documentation, GitHub, and live sessions
- Leading community-driven initiatives such as **ChainConnectNG**
- Working closely with early-stage builders and students
- Collaborating with ecosystem ambassadors and teams

Detailed case studies (including ChainConnectNG) will be added over time as the playbook evolves.
